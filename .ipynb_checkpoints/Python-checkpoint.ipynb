    "Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and [dynamic typing](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DynamicTyping), together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\n",

A variable is a way of referring to a memory location used by a   computer program.In many programming languages a variable is a symbolic name for this physical location. This memory location contains values, like numbers, text or more complicated types. We can use this variable to tell the computer to save some data in this location or to retrieve some data from this location. \n",

It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and [dynamic typing](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DynamicTyping), together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\r\nLike Java, Python is also an [interpreted](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/696764/Differences-between-compiled-and-Interpreted-Langu) programming language.\r\n\r\n### Python 3.x\r\n\r\nCurrent tutorial will be focused on Python 3.x . Python 3.x is the present and future of the language.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Interpreter and Interactive shell\r\nPython is an interpreted language and comes with an interactive shell.The interactive shell is interactive in the way that it stands between the commands or actions and their execution.\r\n\r\nTo fire up the interactive shell,type :\r\n~~~~\r\n$ python3\r\n~~~~\r\nin the terminal on your machine. If Python 3.x is succesfully installed on your machine, you should get such kind of output.\r\n~~~~\r\nPython 3.5.1+ (default, Mar 30 2016, 22:46:26) \r\n[GCC 5.3.1 20160330] on linux\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> \r\n~~~~\r\ntype \r\n~~~~\r\n>>> exit()\r\n~~~~ \r\nto quit the interactive shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Data types and variables\r\n### **What is a variable ?**\r\n\r\n\r\nA variable is something which can change. A variable is a way of referring to a memory location used by a   computer program.In many programming languages a variable is a symbolic name for this physical location. This memory location contains values, like numbers, text or more complicated types. We can use this variable to tell the computer to save some data in this location or to retrieve some data from this location. \r\n\r\n### **How to create a variable in Python ?**\r\n\r\n\r\nYou create a varible in Python by the the following syntax.\r\n\r\n\r\n**variable_name = variable_value**\r\n`my_variable = 90`\r\nHere we have created a variable with identifier name as *my_variable* and has assigned a value of *10* to it.\r\n\r\n#### **How to print something in Python ?**\r\nPython comes with a built in command `print` to print something on the interactive shell.\r\ntype `print(\"Hello world!\")` in the interactive shell, after this you'll see a message; **Hello world!**.\r\nSimilarly to print the variable *my_variable* that we created before, type `print(my_variable)`, you will see a message saying **90**.\r\n\r\nIf something like a prompt comes up, similar like this :\r\n~~~~\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\nNameError: name 'my_variable' is not defined\r\n~~~~ \r\nthis means that we have not defined the variable *my_variable* in Python.",
